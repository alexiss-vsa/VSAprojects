# proj 03: Guessing Game
#
# Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).
# Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high,
# or exactly right. Keep the game going until the user types exit.
# Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
